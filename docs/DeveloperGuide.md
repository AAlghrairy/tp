### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores `Note` objects in three separate lists for each `Person` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Find persons feature

#### 4.1.1 Implementation

This feature allows the user to display selected persons in the contact list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which 
makes use of the method `#updateFilteredPersonList()` to find persons by name or tag.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the find person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `find n/Alex t/friends` to find selected persons.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `FindPersonCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs. 

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `FindPersonCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList()` is called which updates the GUI display with only selected persons shown in the contact list. The command results are then generated and shown to the user.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![FindPersonSequenceDiagram](images/FindPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4.1.2 Design consideration

**Aspect: Should there be a separate find command for name and tag:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A combined command for finding name and tag.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Users may have to remember more prefixes.

* **Alternative 2:** A separate command for finding name and tag.
    * Pros: Commands may be more intuitive to the users.
    * Cons: Possible violation of the DRY principle.

### 4.2 Add players feature

#### 4.2.1 Implementation

This feature allows the user to add players to the strategy board. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which 
makes use of the method `#addPlayer()` and `#updateFilteredPlayerList()` to add a new player to the strategy board.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add player mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `add-player Cena` to add a new player to the strategy board.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddPlayerCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs. 

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddPlayerCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#addPlayer()` is called which adds the new player to an internal list. Inside the function call, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredPlayerList()` is also called which updates the GUI display a new player named "Cena" shown in the strategy board. The command results are then generated and shown to the user.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![AddPlayerSequenceDiagram](images/AddPlayerSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4.2.2 Design consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for players:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A player is a String of player name.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to extend.
* **Alternative 2:** A player is an object of class `Player`.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and manipulate attributes of a player.
    * Cons: Hard to implement.
    
### 4.3 Clear Tasks feature

#### 4.3.1 Implementation

This feature allows users to clear all tasks from the task list, or only tasks that correspond with a given date.
It is facilitated by the `ModelManager` which utilizes the method `deleteTask()` to delete each corresponding task one
by one, or sets a new `TaskBook` object to the `ModelManager` to refresh the task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the clear task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `clear-t 2022-10-10` to clear all tasks that correspond with the date `2022-10-10` in the task list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into the `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable
parser class which corresponds with the provided command to parse the user's inputs. This initializes the `ClearTaskCommandParser`,
where its method `parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: The newly initialized `ClearTaskCommandParser` is then returned to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#deleteTask()` method is called multiple times to remove the 
corresponding tasks from the internal task list. Inside the function call, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList()`
is also called, which updates the GUI to display the new task list. The command results are then generated and shown to
the user.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![ClearTaskSequenceDiagram](images/ClearTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4.3.2 Design consideration

**Aspect: Should there be separate clear commands for clearing tasks and players:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate command for clearing tasks and players.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to extend.
* **Alternative 2:** A combined command for clearing tasks and player.
    * Pros: Easier and more intuitive for the user to understand
    * Cons: Hard to implement.

### 4.4 Add tasks feature

#### 4.4.1 Implementation

This feature allows the user to add tasks to the task list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#addTask()` and `#updateFilteredTaskList()` to add a new task to the task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `add-t n/Meet d/11-11-2022 st/11:00 et/01:00` to add a new task to the task list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddTaskCommandParser` where its method `#parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddTaskCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#addTask()` is called which adds the new task to an internal list. Inside the function call, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList()` is also called which updates the GUI display. A new task named "Meet" with the subsequent date and time details is then shown in the task list.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![AddTaskSequenceDiagram](images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4.4.2 Design consideration

**Aspect: Should there be an abstraction for players:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `add-t` command for creating a task.
    * Pros: Easy to extend and modify.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive for the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Single `add` command that adds tasks/persons depending on parameters.
    * Pros: More intuitive for the user.

### 4.3 Add tags feature

#### 4.3.1 Implementation
This feature allows the user to add tags to contacts in the list. It is facilitated by `ModelManager` which
makes use of the method `#setPerson()` and `#updateFilteredPersonList()` to add tags to a contact.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `tag-add-p 1 friend` to add the tag "friend" to the first contact in the list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable parser class to process the user inputs. This initialises the `AddTagCommandParser` where its method `#parse` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: It then returns a newly initialised `AddTagCommand` back to the `LogicManager` for command execution. This `AddTagCommand` contains information about the new tag (in this case, "friend")

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#setPerson()` is called which edits the tags of the person with the user-supplied tags. The filtered person list is updated with `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList` to display the new information to the user.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![AddTagSequenceDiagram](images/AddTagSequenceDiagram.png)


#### 4.3.2 Design consideration

**Aspect: Should the implementation use the existing edit functionalities in AB3:**
* **Alternative 1:**  Use the current EditCommand class to edit a person's tags.
  * Pros: Maintains abstraction and reuses code instead of writing new code.
  * Cons: Creates a cyclic dependency, making the code base harder to maintain later on

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement AddTagCommand independently, rewriting similar code
  * Pros: Cleaner code and less dependencies
  * Cons: Repetitive code that is not abstracted

### 4.4 Clear Tasks feature

#### 4.4.1 Implementation

This feature allows users to clear all tasks from the task list, or only tasks that correspond with a given date.
It is facilitated by the `ModelManager` which utilizes the method `deleteTask()` to delete each corresponding task one
by one, or sets a new `TaskBook` object to the `ModelManager` to refresh the task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the clear task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user inputs `clear-t 2022-10-10` to clear all tasks that correspond with the date `2022-10-10` in the task list.

Step 2: This argument is passed into the `LogicManager` which calls on `Coach2K22Parser#parseCommand()` to find a suitable
parser class which corresponds with the provided command to parse the user's inputs. This initializes the `ClearTaskCommandParser`,
where its method `parse()` is called to process the user inputs.

Step 3: The newly initialized `ClearTaskCommandParser` is then returned to the `LogicManager` for command execution.

Step 4: During the command execution, the `ModelManager#deleteTask()` method is called multiple times to remove the
corresponding tasks from the internal task list. Inside the function call, the `ModelManager#updateFilteredTaskList()`
is also called, which updates the GUI to display the new task list. The command results are then generated and shown to
the user.

The steps above are summarised using a sequence diagram as shown below.
![ClearTaskSequenceDiagram](images/ClearTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4.4.2 Design consideration

**Aspect: Should there be separate clear commands for clearing tasks and players:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A separate command for clearing tasks and players.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard to extend.
* **Alternative 2:** A combined command for clearing tasks and player.
    * Pros: Easier and more intuitive for the user to understand
    * Cons: Hard to implement.
    * 
### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
